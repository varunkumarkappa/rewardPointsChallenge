Reward Points Use Case:
**********************

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction

(E.g a $120 purchase = 2*20$ + 1*50$ = 90points)

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total
